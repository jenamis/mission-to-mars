# Mars Data Web Scraping

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to automate web scraping to retrieve articles, images, and data related to Mars and display them in a web application. The project utilized Splinter and BeautifulSoup to create an automated web-scraping app, created a MongoDB database to store scraped data, and used Flask and Bootstrap to display the scraped data.  

## Project Components

### Web-Scraping Script
The web-scraping script was originally developed as a [Python script in Jupyter Notebook](Mission_to_Mars_Challenge.ipynb).

### Web-Scraping Web Application
The web-scraping script was then converted to a [Python file](scraping.py) and a [Flask app file](app.py) and [HTML template file](templates/index.html) were developed to automate the web scraping, store the scraped data in a MongoDB database, and display it. Bootstrap components were used in the HTML template file to enhance the visual display of the scraped data.
